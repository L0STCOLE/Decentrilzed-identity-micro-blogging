# 🌐 Decentralized Microblogging Client – AT Protocol Capstone Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a **secure, decentralized microblogging client** built on top of the **AT Protocol**, emphasizing **identity ownership**, **data portability**, and **federated interoperability**.

The client enables users to **migrate their identity and social graph** across platforms without losing data, using **DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)**, user repos, and custom app views — all implemented within a **Big World Design** structure.

## 🎯 Objective
To design and develop a decentralized social media platform that:
- Prioritizes **user control** over their identity and data
- Supports **account migration** and **interoperability** across federated servers
- Demonstrates secure integration of the AT Protocol with scalable client architecture

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages**: JavaScript / TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Protocol**: AT Protocol (Bluesky)
- **Identity Layer**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- **Frontend**: Custom microblogging UI
- **Backend**: Repo sync & user session logic
- **Testing**: Test-Driven Development (TDD), Unit & Integration tests
- **Project Management**: Jira, Confluence, Agile methodology

## 📦 Key Features
- 🔐 **Secure login and identity management** using DIDs
- 🔁 **Account migration tools** to retain social graphs across federated nodes
- 🧩 **App views and user repos** compliant with evolving AT Protocol standards
- 🔧 Built with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** from the ground up
- 🏗️ Supports future extension for media embedding, mentions, and hashtags

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- The **AT Protocol was actively evolving** during development — mid-project schema and API updates required multiple architectural shifts
- Ensured **data migration stability** and **schema consistency** despite shifting protocol specs
- Limited developer documentation and tooling available for AT Protocol at the time

## 📈 Outcomes
- Successfully deployed a working federated client demo using live protocol nodes
- Implemented resilient migration logic for user data and social graphs
- Delivered a polished and documented solution under tight protocol evolution constraints

## 📄 Documentation Included
- AT Protocol integration notes
- Schema definitions for app views and user repos
- DID architecture flow
- TDD test coverage logs and Jira burndown chart

## 🔐 Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Decentralized Identity & Authentication
- Federated Architecture
- Secure Account Portability
- Protocol Adaptability under change

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- migration stability
- Moderation tooling and protocol-compliant flagging
- Public activity feeds and topic aggregation
